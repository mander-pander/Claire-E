          </p>

          <p>
            In these lessons, Eckstein will provide knowledge about
            <ul>
              <li>
                composing your very own original piece (where your creativity can flow freely)
              </li>
              <li>
                how music theory actually works (why music sounds the way it does)
              </li>
              <li>
                arranging an existing piece (adding a new spin on an old song)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            It does not matter what your skill level is. Whether you donâ€™t know how to read music, or you have been a musician for many years and want to hone your skills, Eckstein is committed to help you reach your musical goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lessons will be $25 for a one hour session. Eckstein also offers a bulk pay discount; for a one hour lesson, once a week for four weeks, the price is $90. This is a 10% discount.
